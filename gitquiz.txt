Opened up terminal and cloned my repository.
Went into my repository by doing cd claudia2369-cmis-wd
Typed in gedit to open up a new file.
Saved it and named it as gitquiz.txt
Closed gedit and went back to terminal
Added the git by doing add gitquiz.txt
Commit the git by doing git commit -m "these are the steps to making a new file"
Pushed the git by doing git push 
Went to github to make sure that the new file and changes are there.
